## About
Create and Manipulate Pandas DAtaFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Getting Started
All necessary files are located in this PyCitySchools repository. 

The PyCitySchools folder contains the files PyCitySchools.ipynb and PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb. PyCitySchools.ipynb is the file that you will want to run! The other is for reference as to what we were given to start with and samples of the expected outputs.

The PyCitySchools folder also contains a Resources folder which contains the files schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv which are used for input data for PyCitySchools.ipynb.


## Installing
This was run using gitbash on Windows 10 Pro system.

## Usage
Initiate gitbash on the PyCitySchools folder.  
Enter "conda activate dev" into gitbash to initiate a dev environment.
Enter "jupyter lab" to open Jupyter Lab at the PyCitySchools folder.
You should see the PyCitySchools.ipynb file.
Open and run PyCitySchools.ipynb. The outputs should match the outputs provided in the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb file.


## Contributing
Thank you to CG:AF at Central Grading for refering me to https://community.codenewbie.org/kwing25/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-project-16ej. I have used this as a template instead of the template from the Gitlab repository for class.
